<h1> The Best Movies According to Naini</h1>
<h2> My Top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr>
<h3>In Bruges</h3>
<p> I love the cinematography of the movie. The background score is melodic and haunting. Its my favorite genre - dark comedy. The show has a beautiful well written story arc. It references old myths and painitings from the story very subtly. The actors all did a phenomenal job. Always love a good Irish accent. One of the best things about the movie is its subtlety I find new things to like each time I watch it. The humour is effortless and in the least expected way, it punches you in the gut with a thought provoking story about morality. Its just **chef's kiss**</p>
<h3>Rush</h3>
<p>Again the first thing that I really like is the music, second the cinematography. Beautiful movie. I'm not interested in sports much less F1 racing. But you don't need to be a fan to watch this movie. What I took from it was two completely different outlooks on life but each as fulfilling. Depends on what path is right for you. I guess it changed my life in that sense... maybe. And made me stop comparing my life to others. I mean it I still do it sometimes but not as much. Also its just a good watch. Little slow but I like slow movies so...</p>
<h3>Shiva Baby</h3>
<p>ok...not reallly a fav but very underrated Indie movie and a great concept. Its fun to watch...thoroughly entertaining and new concept. My fav creator @friendlyspaceninja said it best- It's a 1.5 hour anxiety attack (in the best way possible ofc). </p>
